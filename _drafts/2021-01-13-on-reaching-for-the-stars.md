**On Reaching for the Stars**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- _from the lifetime of a toy_

You’ve forgotten now

of the days you took me to the moon,

your feet teetering back and forth

in proud possession of the galaxies.

Giddy upon gifts galore,

as Naïveté pampers you with a limitless domain,

you claim Invincibility as boldly as

the resolution booming

in your teeny bones.

So onwards we conquer all the planets,

pitter-pattering across the stars

that burn on nothing more

than grand ambitions running

<div style = "text-indent: 50px">fantasy bound.</div>

In a distant haze,

are the somber nights

you clutched me tight,

consumed by fever dreams,

cruel night terrors,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the birth of Doubt.

Your heartbeat thumps against my ear,

heaving with that helpless dread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invincibility taking its slumber

as your tears find the fine strands of my hair,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stars are burning a little less brightly tonight.

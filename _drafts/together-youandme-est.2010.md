The air was still hot.<br>

Summer had not left us<br>

though Autumn had come down<br>

to reign here beside her.<br>

You picked me up--I remember searching<br>

for your car in the parking lot.<br>

That day, things changed.<br>

There were new experiences--<br>

the constant feelings of<br>

today can’t be over yet<br>

and<br>

I’m not ready to leave you<br>

that made me feel like everything leading up to<br>

You<br>

was only practice.<br>

Home is a cold room<br>

My numb hand<br>

folded into yours<br>

as we move along<br>

sometimes slowly<br>

Other times twisting and turning<br>

so fast<br>

That you can hear the shink of our blades.<br>

This was a bad idea.

If there was anything Zoya was sure of, it was that this was a bad idea. Her mom was going to kill her. So was Nana \[Hindi word for Grandfather\]. And Uncle Dan. You didn’t just do this kind of thing and expect to get away with it.

“Do we have any more Milky Ways, Zo-Chan?”

Zoya took her eyes off the road for a moment to frown pointedly at the wrinkled old man in her passenger seat. He was digging around in her glove compartment, the blanket covering his knees forgotten as his slightly trembling hands scrabbled for more chocolate.

“I thought I warned you not to eat them all back in Santa Ana, Gramps.”

Gramps pouted, a little uncertain, and then leaned back again in his seat. “I was sure I saved one…” he mumbled, staring out the window, watching the Pacific glitter in the afternoon sun.

Zoya sighed. He was suddenly smaller in the seat, clutching at his ratty blanket again for comfort.

“We can stop for some at the next gas station if you want.”

“Really?” he chirped, his eyes lighting up. “You’re sure it’s not too much trouble?”

That startled a laugh out of Zoya.

“I’m already in trouble, Gramps,” she said, trying for a reassuring smile. “Another pit stop isn’t going to make it any worse.”

That was a lie. Uncle Dan had said that he was going to come by the hospital at six-thirty. He was going to come, and find Gramps missing, put two-and-two together, and tell her mother what she’d done. She could almost hear her voice in her head.

_‘You’ve only had your license for two months, Zoya! How could you be so irresponsible? Why didn’t you call us? What if something had happened to him on your way there? What if something happened to you?’_

The longer they stayed out, the more weeks would be added to her sentence. Maybe Ammi would be kind and just ground her till the end of May. She’d made plans for the summer.

“Oh, please, it’s not like you kidnapped me,” Gramps giggled, giving her a toothy grin. “I wanted to go!”

“You explain it to Ammi then!” Zoya huffed. “You’re a bad influence, Gramps.”

“A bad influence, huh?” he mused, smiling a secret sort of smile, like he was sharing a private joke with himself. “My Sunflower would be so disappointed in me.”

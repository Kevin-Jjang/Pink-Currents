“I’m sorry, I didn’t expect it to actually happen.”

“I know, and I should’ve known it was going to.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mother and her daughter,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soaked in seawater,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oblivious to the stranger

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who watches in amusement

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they sink into revelries,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forming childhood memories,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stumbling through the sand,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clasping hands,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shivering in their nicest dresses,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which still bubble with seafoam

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* _Don’t Tell Your Father When We Get Home / Let’s Find a Towel_

“I’m sorry, I didn’t expect it to actually happen.”

“I know, and I should’ve known it was going to.”

     A mother and her daughter,

     Soaked in seawater,

     Oblivious to the stranger

     Who watches in amusement

     As they sink into revelries,

     Forming childhood memories,

     Stumbling through the sand,

     And clasping hands,

     Shivering in their nicest dresses,

     Which still bubble with seafoam

          - _Don’t Tell Your Father When We Get Home / Let’s Find a Towel_

<br>Like the drilling of acrylic nails drumming on clicking keyboards,

Or the popping static voiced by spinning, ragged records,

Or the dance of bacon grease leaping out of a feverish pan,

Quite roughly, metronomically:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raindrops scattered on dim windshields,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wipers rest, rejoin, reveal:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dashboard canvas, an artful blur,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smeared watercolor

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of high-beam white and stoplight red

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through squinted eyes and halting turns

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Drive Safely / Text Me When You’re Home_

Currently, we do not have the funds to pay our contributors. 

We take submissions by Google Form. We will ask for your email address, name, title of your story, and what type of work it is (prose, poetry, art, other), and an anonymized copy of your work. Optional: cover letter* and links to your other works.

Short and sweet, right?

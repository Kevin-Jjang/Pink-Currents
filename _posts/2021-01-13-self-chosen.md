_A fortnight ago,_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when the wind blew gray and nigh

_he left his doors to enter_

_through the sullen quiet of the forbidden moor_

_in search of something he could call more his own_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _a quest, a journey, love or adventure’s sake_

_his destination along the horizon._

_Beside him existed neither roaring seas_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _nor sublime cliffs_

_No trials almighty to be vanquished by heroes_

_But there is nothing quite like the open sight_

_of lilac heather amidst sage brush; still,_

_he looked, and turned, and averted his eyes_

_His gaze affixed to the line of light_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_breaking ahead of him._

_At a fortunate intersection of brook and path_

_was he met by a lady of comely dress_

_Said she,_

_with a gesture to a pair of weeping willows, and a nod_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _to her lawn manicured with the riches of a thousand men,  
—Welcome to my grounds, do join me inside,_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I’ll put on a kettle of tea and bring out my good honey_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I’ve not much company, you see._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I’ve waited so long for someone to talk to_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Won’t you sit down with me?—_

_but our fellow laughed and_

_denied her with neither a glance o’er her valued domain_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_nor o’er her tender smile and eyes._

_You’ve not what I desire, said he_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I’ve no time for distraction._

_Then farewell and continue on, she said,_

_and looked the other way_

_as he returned to his path in the weeds._

_After some days, and nights, and afternoons too,_

_he wandered into an assemblage of persons, all ages_

_Said they,_

_with gestures to a flourishing table of hearty laughter, and nods_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_to the greenest pasture in the land,_

_—Please join our feast, celebrate with us a strong harvest_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_we’ve meat from our animals and wine from our grapes._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_and you need not starve a day with our bounty of crops._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Come, take a look around,_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_we’d be delighted to show you the grounds—_

_but our man smiled small and_

_rejected them with neither a look o’er their precious gardens_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_nor o’er their glorious fruits and blossoms._

_Your food and drink are not what I pursue, said he_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I’ve no time for distraction._

_Then farewell and continue on, they said,_

_and turned their backs on him as he fell back into step_

_in pursuit of his ever-chased light._

_Rolling hills, scarlet birdsong, jeweled dew_

_Dandelions nodding their heads_

_All to the side of his path_

_And a small mouse, scurrying by, invisible_

_Accidental companion to the one forging_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_his way through the landscape_

_Asked another—_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_for what does he abandon such opportunity?_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_for what does he ignore such chance?—_

_The winds echoed his inquiry_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_as did the persons left behind_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_silently, in the depths of their minds_

_But our fellow’s sight remained steady._

_And he walked,_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_and walked, and walked_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_and found nothing as the grasses passed him by  
Satisfaction he sought_

_and for the welcoming calls he cared naught_

_A lonely journey, self-chosen_

_And the moor, well._

_She said good riddance._

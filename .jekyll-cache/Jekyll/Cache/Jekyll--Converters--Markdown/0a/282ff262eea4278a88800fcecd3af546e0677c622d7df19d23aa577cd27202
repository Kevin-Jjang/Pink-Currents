<p>My mother stands there at the sink, washing the dishes<br />That were used just minutes before.<br />And her hands go washing, washing,<br />As she stares at her reflection in the window.</p>

<p>She’s running towards a jungle,<br />While the sun licks at her mocha skin.<br />And they cry <em>‘Morena! Morena!’</em><br />As she laughs and tries to catch at birds the color of the rainbow.</p>

<p>She’s moving from a homeland,<br />A strange language on her lips.<br />And her dreams are larger than the moon and the earth,<br />More infinitely grand than the stars.</p>

<p>She’s walking down a street,<br />In the place where futures are made<br />And her passion runs hotter than the blood in her veins,<br />Yearning for a chance to be great.</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>My mother stands now at the sink, washing the dishes,<br />That I used just minutes before.<br />And her hands go washing, washing,<br />As she stares at her reflection in the window</p>

<p>And sees all those dreams fly away,<br />Just like jungle birds<br />The color of the rainbow.</p>

I"L<p>a draft of wind that touched the sea<br />upon a starless night<br />it was but red, imagined bliss<br />exposed beneath the clouds</p>

<p>it curled and crawled —slid up my feet<br />at last our sweet reunion.<br />Alas the news have missed our steps,<br />we sway against communion.</p>

<p>a venom taste, enchanted scent<br />Dear Space, condense our doubts<br />if truth the remedy —our sins, goodbye<br />I dwell —restored at last</p>

<p>pressed against a tungsten light,<br />the silhouette of sanity.<br />the only memory that remains:<br />dancing — in the ocean.</p>

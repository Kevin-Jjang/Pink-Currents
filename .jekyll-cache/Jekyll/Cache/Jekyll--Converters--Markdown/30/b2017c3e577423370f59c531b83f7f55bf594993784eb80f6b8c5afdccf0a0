I"Ö<p>Dear UCSD wifi, you quirky gal,<br />Youâ€™re the ultimate femme fatale:<br />Mysterious, fragile, an insurmountable shell-<br />Being cast from your side is unbearable hell.</p>

<p>You know youâ€™re an affection fiend;<br />You covet my attention, my jealous queen.<br />Youâ€™ll connect with me as bright as dawn,<br />But my crush snapchats me- suddenly, youâ€™re gone.</p>

<p>Like an old loverâ€™s lost caress,<br />Youâ€™re mine one moment, memories the next.<br />I am a member of your endless empire<br />And your mere touch I do desire</p>

<p>But, like a long-distance high school romance,<br />You never really had a chance<br />Because last month I got unlimited data<br />LTE is first; youâ€™re now beta.</p>
